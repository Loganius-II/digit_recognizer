# AI digit recognizer
A neural network that trains on the MNIST dataset and can identify handwritten digits
## The neural network is created from scratch
That means no tensorflow or pytorch or anything... just pure mathmatical formulas
## The `digit_recog.py` uses tensorflow but the `digit_recog_scratch.py` is from scratch
